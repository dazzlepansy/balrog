# Balrog

A partial drop-in replacement for [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and
[pass-otp](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp) written in POSIX shell.

## What is this?

There is no particularly good reason to want to replace pass and pass-otp,
which are excellent utilities, but I fancied the idea of writing a simple
drop-in replacement for them written in POSIX-compliant shell. There were a
few hiccups along the way, but it largely works for my own purposes. Users
should be warned against using this in a production context, but I use it
happily and wanted to share it for educational or reference purposes.

Why is it called Balrog? Because "you shall not pass." Haaaaah.

## Dependencies

* A POSIX shell. The `balrog` script is strictly POSIX compliant to
  ensure maximum portability.
* [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip). Copies the password to the
  clipboard.
* [OATH Toolkit](https://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/) (optional). Used for
  handling one-time passwords.

## Features Implemented

Balrog is entirely compatible with pass and pass-otp, but only implements a
subset of their features. The following command-line options are implemented:

* -c|--clip
  Copy to clipboard.
* -i|--in-place
  When generating a password, replace only the first line of the file instead
  of writing over it.
* -n|--no-symbols
  Generate passwords with only alphanumeric characters.

The following actions are implemented:

* edit
* generate
* otp
* show

Use the exact same way you currently use pass. See the documentation of pass
and pass-otp for details.
